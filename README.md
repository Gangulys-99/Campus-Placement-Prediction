The scope of this project is to determine the campus placement status of a student. Our model has been designed using two classification algorithms namely Logistic Regression and Naive Bayesâ€™ approach. This project can be easily implemented under various situations. We can add features as and when required. Reusability and flexibility can be exhibited in the modules. This project is extendable in ways that its original developers may not expect. The model enhances extensibility like Supervised Learning and binary classification. With the advent of upgraded version of the programming language we might be to reduce the code and simplify our understanding.

Over here the ".ipynb" file along with the dataset and the detailed study report has been provided for a better understanding of our project.

Few point :-

Dataset collected from Kaggle
Our model may not achieve the best accuracy(fiddling with the various parameters may enhance it)
This project was made as a part of our Summer Training on "Machine Learning with Python"
