We made this project as a part of our Summer Training on "Machine Learning with Python". The scope of this project is to determine the campus placement status of a student. Our model has been designed using two classification algorithms namely Logistic Regression and Naive Bayesâ€™ approach. This project can be easily implemented under various situations. We can add features as and when required. Reusability and flexibility can be exhibited in the modules. This project is extendable in ways that its original developers may not expect. The model enhances extensibility like Supervised Learning and binary classification. With the advent of an upgraded version of the programming language, we might be able to reduce the code and simplify our understanding.

Over here the ".ipynb" file along with the dataset and the detailed study report has been provided for a better understanding of our project.

A few points to note:-

The dataset used in the project has been provided for reference:
Jain University Bangalore Campus Placement Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/benroshan/factors-affecting-campus-placement?select=Placement_Data_Full_Class.csv
Contains 215 student records
Includes secondary and higher secondary school percentages and specialization
Also includes degree specialization, type and work experience, and salary offers to the placed students
Placed (label = 1)
Not Placed (label = 0)
90/10 train/test split

Our model may not achieve the best accuracy(fiddling with the various parameters may enhance it)
